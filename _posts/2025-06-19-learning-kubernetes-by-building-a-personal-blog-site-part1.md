Welcome to the first post in our "Learning Kubernetes by Building a Personal Blog Site" series! In this post, we‚Äôll walk through how to set up a blog site locally ‚Äî the blog site is just like the one you‚Äôre reading now!

By the end of this post, you‚Äôll be able to:
1. Set up your own blog site locally using the same theme as this blog.
2. Deploy your blog to GitHub Pages so that others can access it at a URL like `https://<your-github-username>.github.io/`. For example, mine is [https://yoyoduan.github.io](https://yoyoduan.github.io).

> üìå Tip: If you‚Äôre here mainly for Kubernetes, you can skip the deployment to GitHub Pages section below. This post also works as a standalone tutorial on setting up a personal blog.

Our blog uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator written in Ruby. But don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî you **don‚Äôt** need to know Ruby, and you don‚Äôt need to be a frontend expert to follow along. I‚Äôm not either. If you‚Äôve got some basic programming experience and can use Git and a terminal, you‚Äôre good to go.

### What you‚Äôll need:

* You‚Äôre comfortable writing in Markdown.
* You have some programming experience (frontend, backend, or DevOps ‚Äî any is fine).
* You know how to use Git and GitHub.
* You know basic Linux terminal commands.

## Set Up Your Blog Site Locally

This blog uses the [Chirpy Jekyll theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/). Most of the setup steps follow its official [Getting Started](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/) guide ‚Äî with beginner-friendly explanations added.

Think of any application setup as needing three parts:
1. A **runtime environment**
2. The **actual project source code**
3. The **dependencies** of project needs to run

Let‚Äôs walk through each step.

---

### Step 1: Install the Runtime Environment (Linux Only)

I‚Äôm using Ubuntu, so I‚Äôll show the setup steps for Linux. If you're using Windows or macOS, check [Jekyll's installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

This installs:
* **Ruby** ‚Äì Jekyll is a Ruby program, so this is essential. This comes from the `ruby-full`.
* **Gem** ‚Äì The Ruby package manager, used to install Ruby packages called **gems**. It‚Äôs included in `ruby-full` as well.
* **Node.js** ‚Äì Required by the Jekyll Chirpy theme to support features like search and dark mode. This comes from the `nodejs`.
* **Other prerequisite build tools**: `build-essential` and `zlib1g-dev`. These are needed to compile certain Ruby gems. Honestly, I don‚Äôt fully understand what they do either ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay. You can still follow this guide without knowing the details.

Now, install the required gems ‚Äî Jekyll and Bundler:

```bash
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

gem install jekyll bundler
```

> üìù **What do the first four commands do?**
>
> These lines:
>
> * Set an environment variable `GEM_HOME`. This tells Ruby to install gems into `~/gems`, a folder in your home directory where you always have write access.
> * Add `$HOME/gems/bin` to your system `PATH`, so you can run installed gems like `jekyll` or `bundler` directly from the command line ‚Äî without needing to specify their full path (e.g., from `~/gems/bin/bundler` to simply `bundler`).
> * Save these settings in your `.bashrc` file so they persist across terminal sessions.

> üí° **Why not just use `sudo gem install`?**
>
> By default, Ruby tries to install gems system-wide, which often requires `sudo` and can cause permission issues or conflicts with system-level packages. It‚Äôs safer to install them locally in your home directory (`~/gems`), where you always have write access.

> üîß **What‚Äôs Bundler?**
>
> Bundler manages Ruby dependencies. It makes sure you have the right versions of gems installed, helping avoid compatibility issues during builds.

### Step 2: Get Your Blog Project Source Code from GitHub
1. Fork the [chirpy-starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter) repository to your own GitHub account. This is the template we'll use to build your blog.
2. Name the forked repository `<your-username>.github.io`.
   This is required if you want to host it using GitHub Pages. After deployment, your blog site will be publicly accessible at `https://<your-username>.github.io`.
3. Clone the repo to your local computer:
   ```bash
   cd <your-project-folder>
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-username>.github.io.git
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yoyoduan/yoyoduan.github.io.git
   ```

---

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies
The Chirpy theme requires some additional gems to work properly. These are listed in a file named `Gemfile` in the root of your project repository ‚Äî think of it as a "shopping list" of required gems.

To install them, navigate to your project folder and run:
```bash
bundle
```

This command will:
* Install all the gems listed in the `Gemfile`
* Automatically install any sub-dependencies those gems require

---

## Run Your Blog Locally
Everything is ready now ‚Äî let‚Äôs start the blog server and see it in action! In your terminal, run:
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

After a few seconds, you‚Äôll see your blog running at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000):

### Add Your First Blog Post

Want to write your first post? Just create a new `.md` file (a Markdown file) under the `_posts/` directory. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```markdown
---
title: My First Blog
date: 2025-06-17 10:38:00 +0800
description: A sample blog
categories: [Blog]
tags: [jekyll]
---

## Introduction
My first blog!
```

> The block at the top (`---`) is called **front matter**. It tells Jekyll about the post‚Äôs metadata, like the title and date. It won‚Äôt appear on the page, but Jekyll needs it to build the post properly.

Now refresh your browser ‚Äî you should see the new post on the homepage. Click it to read your content!

## (Optional) Deploy to GitHub Pages
Seeing your blog locally is fun ‚Äî but what if you want to share it with the world?

GitHub Pages lets you host static websites for **free**! Just push your latest change to GitHub, and your blog will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io`. Make sure your repository name is **exactly** `<your-username>.github.io`.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add my first blog"
git push origin main
```

Then:

1. Go to your repo on GitHub ‚Üí **Settings**
2. Click **Pages** in the sidebar
3. Under "GitHub Pages", click **Visit site**

> ‚è≥ It might take a few minutes before your blog appears. Be patient!

## Next Steps

Now that your blog is up and running, you're ready for the next phase ‚Äî **containerizing** it with Docker.

Not sure what "containerizing" means? I‚Äôll explain it in detail in the next post. But here's a quick preview: it's a way to "package" your blog site into a single, portable unit that can be deployed anywhere. This will help us run the blog not only on your local machine, but also inside a Kubernetes cluster.
